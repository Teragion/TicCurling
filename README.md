# TicCurling
GAME ON!

### Rules
1. Players launch curling of different colors from a point in  the lower part of the screen. The curling may bounce with other objects in the field. Once the speed of the curling is reduced to 0, it disappears and spawns a blocker of the player's color in the nearest position.
2. When a line of blocks is completely occupied by players of whatever color, the game stops. The area including this line and above this line would be calculated for score. The player who occupies more area in this section wins.
3. If a player occupies 3 blocks of a 2*2 block, the last one would be automatically **changed** to his color. This process is done **recursively**.
